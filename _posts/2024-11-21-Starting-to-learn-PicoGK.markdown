Starting my journey with computational engineering.

[PicoGK][picogk-github] ('peacock') is an open-source geometry kernel.

## Coding for engineers
[Coding for engineers][coding-for-engineers] is a book published by Linn Kayser from LEAP71. The book is not finished and new chapters are being published.

Linn covers the following on the first chapters of the book:
* Theory and concepts
* Focuses on the right way of understanding
