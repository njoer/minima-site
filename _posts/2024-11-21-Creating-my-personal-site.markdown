I realised that I was in a need for personal web-page that includes my CV, projects and a blog.

After some research I decided to go with GitHub Pages and using Jekyll for the site development. 


### GitHub Pages
GitHub offers free hosting for the website. It offers a CI/CD pipeline so that creating and managing the site is easy.



### Why Jekyll?

> Jekyll is used for 'Simple, blog-aware, static sites'.

#### Jekyll Templates
There are a variety of free templates available, but for the sake of learning I decided to start building from scratch and keep this site also as a personal project.
